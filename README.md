## Check out [this](https://github.com/ongsalt/schedule-api-v2) for the rest of the project.

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# yarn
yarn install

# npm
npm install

# pnpm
pnpm install
```

## Development Server

Edit database url in `.env` file and Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`

```bash
npm run dev
```

### I highly recommend to setup using [docker compose](https://github.com/ongsalt/schedule-api-v2) instead.

Check out the [Nuxt docs](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deployment) for more information.
